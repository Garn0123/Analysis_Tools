This is a collection of Analysis tools used by the Rizzo Lab for various purposes, organized by directory.

They are included in one repo for easy cloning.

These scripts are currently split into 3 directories:

1. graphs&visualizing - Scripts for generating graphs or visualization of data in a graphical manner.
2. inputs - Input files for generating outputs used in analyses.
3. utilities - Files for compiling data, debugging, or manipulating mol2's.
